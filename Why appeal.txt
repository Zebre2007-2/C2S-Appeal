I can accept being banned for talking about politics (I know the server's rules), but at some point, this is just too much. What I explained in the previous message clearly shows that I wasn’t the only one discussing politics, and I was far from being the main agitator. Sungus influenced Corvus to take the Politest as well, and since Corvus wasn’t punished, I did the same. Moreover, I wasn’t the one who started a major debate about the Rassemblement National (a far-right French political party). At the very least, Sungus should also be banned since he actively talked about politics too.

If you decide not to lift my ban, I would understand, but if you also refuse to ban Sungus, that would be illogical—especially since he was promoting his party on the server. He kept provoking me (except when we were talking about C2S), so I responded because I can’t stand being provoked.

As for Corvus, he was simply influenced, so I forgive him, as well as Mnemox, who defended me when Sungus was making all sorts of implied insults about me while I wasn’t around.



Sorry for my English, I’m pretty good at it, but not good enough to write long paragraphs like these, so I had to use a translator.
